h1. Linux Firewall Helpers

iptables rules management (and safety).

Firewall rules and configuration files reside in /etc/fw

Configure available rules in /etc/fw/rules.available directory.

Enabled rules are symlinked into /etc/fw/rules.enabled

h1. /etc/fw/fwctl

Firewall control script.

h3. show

Shows enabled rules (the symlinks currenlty in rules.enabled).

h3. apply-rules

Apply currently enabled rules.

h3. enable rule

Enable a rule, by copying it into rules.enabled.

h3. disable rule

Disable a rule, by removing the copying from rules.enabled.

h3. test rule

Apply a rule, without making it permanent (i.e. copying into rules.enabled).

h3. reset

Clear and re-apply the currently enabled rules.  This is used to recover from testing a rule that locks you out of the system.

h3. restore-check

If /etc/fw/trigger is newer than /etc/fw/rules.current (i.e. the trigger file has been touched), this will clear and reapply all of the current rules.

h3. clear

Disables all firewall rules

h1. Crontab

Intall into /etc/cron.d

Runs 'fwcntl restore-check' every 5 minutes to save you when you lock yourself out.
